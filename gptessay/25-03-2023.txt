In recent years, online gaming has become increasingly popular, with many different games available for players to enjoy. Two such games that have gained considerable popularity are Defusal and ZombsRoyale.io. While both games have their merits, in this essay, I will argue that Defusal is better than ZombsRoyale.io for several reasons.

Firstly, the developers of ZombsRoyale.io have shown a concerning attitude towards competition. They have banned the word "Defusal" on their Discord server, which is a clear indication that they are worried about the popularity of Defusal. This is a highly unprofessional and unethical approach to competition, which is counterproductive to the gaming industry's growth as a whole. In contrast, the developers of Defusal have been supportive of other games and have never attempted to ban or limit discussions about other games.

Secondly, the moderation on ZombsRoyale.io's Discord server has been heavily criticized for power tripping, with Yunica being the main culprit. In one particular incident, Creaffy was muted for absolutely no valid reason that didn't make any sense at all. Creaffy had made an unserious comment regarding Yunica's previous unfair decision to mute Jamz for a full day, which seemed to have hurt Yunica's ego. As a result, she decided to mute Creaffy, despite the comment being harmless and not violating any of the server's rules.

This incident highlights the arbitrary nature of the moderation on ZombsRoyale.io's Discord server, where moderators can mute or ban users for minor infractions or even for no reason at all. Such behavior is highly unprofessional and can be extremely frustrating for players who are simply trying to engage with the community and have fun. In contrast, the moderation on Defusal's Discord server has been exemplary, with moderators actively engaging with the community and addressing concerns promptly and professionally.

Overall, the incident involving Creaffy highlights the power tripping behavior of Yunica and the lack of accountability on ZombsRoyale.io's Discord server. Players deserve to have a safe and respectful community where they can engage with others and have fun without fear of arbitrary punishments or unfair treatment. Defusal provides such a community, making it a better game than ZombsRoyale.io.

Furthermore, Defusal offers a unique and challenging gameplay experience that ZombsRoyale.io simply cannot match. Defusal is a game that requires players to work together to defuse bombs, which not only requires skill but also teamwork and communication. This type of gameplay fosters a sense of community and encourages players to work together towards a common goal. In contrast, ZombsRoyale.io is a battle royale game that involves little to no teamwork and is mainly focused on individual skill.

In addition to the points, another reason why Defusal is a better game than ZombsRoyale.io is that the latter has been milking its players for their money by only releasing cosmetics hidden behind a micro-transaction paywall for years now with little to no gameplay updates.

ZombsRoyale.io has been heavily criticized for its business model, which focuses on making money from its players rather than improving the game itself. This is evidenced by the fact that the game has not received any significant gameplay updates in years, despite being a highly popular game. Instead, the developers have been releasing new cosmetic items that are only available through micro-transactions, which are often expensive and do not add any significant value to the gameplay experience.

On the other hand, Defusal has a fair business model that rewards players for their skills and dedication to the game. The game offers a wide range of customization options that are available to players without having to spend any money. Additionally, the game's developers have been actively working on improving the gameplay experience by introducing new features and updates that keep the game fresh and exciting for its players.

In conclusion, while both Defusal and ZombsRoyale.io are popular games, Defusal is the superior game. The developers of Defusal have shown a supportive attitude towards other games, and the moderation on their Discord server has been exemplary. Additionally, Defusal offers a unique and challenging gameplay experience that promotes teamwork and communication, which is essential for building a strong gaming community. Therefore, I would highly recommend Defusal to anyone looking for a new and exciting gaming experience.
